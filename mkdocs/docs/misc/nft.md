## Questions

* How does lazy-minting really work?
* Moving NFTs from one contract to another?
* NFTs on multiple chains?
    * Probably doesn't make sense as owner would need to aquire ownership on all blockchains
* ERC721 or ERC1155? Which implementation?
* How do auctionning work, on-chain?
* Integration with Etherscan
* How is the tokenId created, same across multiple contracts?
* Can royalty be bypassed?
